# CONCEPT GENERATION PROMPTS
# GreenGrow: Journey of the Green Seed
# Used for brainstorming and ideation phase
# ===============================================

## Phase 1: Initial Game Concept (October 2025)

### Main Concept Prompt
"""
Create a web-based educational game concept that teaches players about environmental sustainability and the UN Sustainable Development Goals. The game should:
- Be engaging and fun for ages 10+
- Include interactive gameplay elements
- Incorporate visual progression/rewards
- Focus on SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption), SDG 13 (Climate Action), and SDG 15 (Life on Land)
- Be playable in a web browser without plugins
- Include educational content about recycling and waste management
- Use HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript only
- Have a pixel art visual style
- Be mobile-responsive

The game should use a metaphor of growing a tree to represent positive environmental impact.
"""

### Game Name Brainstorming
"""
Generate creative names for an environmental game about growing trees through eco-friendly actions:
- Should be memorable and appealing to young audiences
- Should reflect environmental/sustainability themes
- Should suggest growth or positive change
- Bonus: Include nature-related words

Final choice: "GreenGrow: Journey of the Green Seed"
"""

## Tree Growth Metaphor Prompt

"""
Design a visual progression system where a tree grows from seed to full blossom based on player actions. The tree should have 5 distinct stages:
1. Seed in soil
2. First sprout with small leaves
3. Young sapling with developing branches
4. Growing tree with fuller canopy
5. Mature blossoming tree with flowers/fruit

Each stage should be visually distinct and rewarding. The tree represents the player's positive environmental impact.
"""

## Phase 4: Mini-Game Selection and Design

### Game Concepts Brainstorming
"""
Suggest 2-3 mini-game concepts that teach environmental awareness:
- Games should be simple, browser-based, and require minimal controls
- Should teach about waste management, recycling, or sustainability
- Should be appropriate for educational settings
- One should be knowledge-based (quiz), others action-based (arcade)
- Games should award points that contribute to tree growth
- Each game should be completable in 2-5 minutes
- Mobile-friendly controls (touch or keyboard only)

Final selections:
1. Knowledge Quiz - Multiple choice questions about environment
2. Trash Sorting Game - Action game with falling items and moving bins
"""

### Quiz Game Design
"""
Design a 10-question multiple choice quiz about:
- SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production
- SDG 13: Climate Action
- SDG 15: Life on Land
- Waste management best practices
- Environmental facts and statistics
- Real-world sustainability actions

Each question should:
- Have 4 answer options
- Include one correct answer
- Provide educational explanation after answering
- Award 10 points per correct answer
- Be age-appropriate and engaging
"""

### Trash Sorting Game Mechanics
"""
Design an action game where:
- Items fall from the top of the screen
- Player controls a bin that moves left-right
- Player must catch items in the correct colored bin
- Correct catches award +10 points
- Wrong catches deduct -5 points
- Game has a time limit (60 seconds)
- Items spawn continuously until time expires
- Visual feedback shows correct/wrong catches
- Score determines if player passes (50+ points)
"""

## Phase 2: Color-Coded Waste Bins System

### Waste Management Concept
"""
Design a waste sorting system using international color standards:
- Green bin: Recyclable waste (plastic, paper, glass, metal, aluminum)
- Brown bin: Organic/compostable waste (food scraps, yard waste, biodegradables)
- Grey/Black bin: General/residual waste (non-recyclables, mixed materials)
- Red bin: Hazardous waste (batteries, chemicals, electronics, medical waste)

Create a comprehensive list of common household items and which bin they belong in. 
Make it educational and accurate to real-world waste management practices.
Include specific examples for each category that students would encounter daily.
"""

### Trash Items Database
"""
Generate 20+ common household items with:
- Item name
- Emoji representation
- Correct bin color
- Brief educational explanation
- Real-world recycling facts

Items should be recognizable to young audiences and span all four bin categories.
"""

## Phase 3: Target Audience and Learning Objectives

### Audience Definition
"""
Define the target audience and learning objectives for an environmental game:

Target Audience:
- Primary: Students ages 10-16 (middle school)
- Secondary: General public interested in sustainability
- Tertiary: Educators looking for environmental teaching tools

Accessibility:
- Must work on school computers and tablets
- Should be playable in 5-15 minute sessions
- No installation or login required
- Works offline after initial load
"""

### Learning Objectives
"""
Players should be able to:
1. Identify and sort waste into 4 correct bin categories
2. Explain why proper waste sorting matters for the environment
3. Recognize SDG 12, 13, and 15 and their importance
4. Understand the lifecycle of different waste materials
5. Apply waste management knowledge to real-world scenarios
- Develop habits that support environmental sustainability
- Feel empowered to make eco-friendly choices
"""

## Gamification Strategy Prompt

"""
Design a gamification system for an environmental education game:
- Point system (Green Points as currency)
- Visual progression (tree growth stages)
- Immediate feedback (correct/incorrect sorting)
- Educational moments (quiz questions with explanations)
- Achievement milestones (reaching new tree stages)
- Emotional engagement (nurturing a living thing)

Balance fun gameplay with educational value.
