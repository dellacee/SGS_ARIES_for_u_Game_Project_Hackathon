# CONCEPT GENERATION PROMPTS
# Used for brainstorming and ideation phase

## Initial Game Concept Prompt

"""
Create a web-based educational game concept that teaches players about environmental sustainability and the UN Sustainable Development Goals. The game should:
- Be engaging and fun for ages 10+
- Include interactive gameplay elements
- Incorporate visual progression/rewards
- Focus on SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption), SDG 13 (Climate Action), and SDG 15 (Life on Land)
- Be playable in a web browser without plugins
- Include educational content about recycling and waste management

The game should use a metaphor of growing a tree to represent positive environmental impact.
"""

## Tree Growth Metaphor Prompt

"""
Design a visual progression system where a tree grows from seed to full blossom based on player actions. The tree should have 5 distinct stages:
1. Seed in soil
2. First sprout with small leaves
3. Young sapling with developing branches
4. Growing tree with fuller canopy
5. Mature blossoming tree with flowers/fruit

Each stage should be visually distinct and rewarding. The tree represents the player's positive environmental impact.
"""

## Mini-Game Selection Prompt

"""
Suggest 2-3 mini-game concepts that teach environmental awareness:
- Games should be simple, browser-based, and require minimal controls
- Should teach about waste management, recycling, or sustainability
- Should be appropriate for educational settings
- One should be knowledge-based, others action-based
- Games should award points that contribute to tree growth
"""

## Color-Coded Waste Bins Concept

"""
Design a waste sorting system using international color standards:
- Green bin: Recyclable waste (plastic, paper, glass, metal)
- Brown bin: Organic/compostable waste (food scraps, yard waste)
- Grey/Black bin: General/residual waste (non-recyclables)
- Red bin: Hazardous waste (batteries, chemicals, electronics)

Create a list of common household items and which bin they belong in. Make it educational and accurate to real-world waste management practices.
"""

## Game Name and Branding Prompt

"""
Generate creative names for an environmental education game about growing a tree through eco-friendly actions. The name should:
- Be memorable and positive
- Reference growth, nature, or sustainability
- Be appropriate for all ages
- Work well as a hashtag
- Suggest hope and positive change

Consider variations with words like: Green, Grow, Seed, Sprout, Eco, Earth, Life, Journey, Quest
"""

## Target Audience and Learning Objectives

"""
Define the target audience and learning objectives for an environmental game:

Target Audience:
- Primary: Students ages 10-16

Learning Objectives:
- Understand the UN SDGs related to environment
- Learn proper waste segregation techniques
- Recognize different types of waste and their environmental impact
- Understand the importance of recycling and composting
- Develop habits that support environmental sustainability
- Feel empowered to make eco-friendly choices
"""

## Gamification Strategy Prompt

"""
Design a gamification system for an environmental education game:
- Point system (Green Points as currency)
- Visual progression (tree growth stages)
- Immediate feedback (correct/incorrect sorting)
- Educational moments (quiz questions with explanations)
- Achievement milestones (reaching new tree stages)
- Emotional engagement (nurturing a living thing)

Balance fun gameplay with educational value.
