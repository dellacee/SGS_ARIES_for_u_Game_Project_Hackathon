# 🌱 GreenGrow: Journey of the Green Seed

**A web-based educational game about environmental sustainability and SDGs**

---

## 📖 Project Overview

**GreenGrow: Journey of the Green Seed** is an interactive educational web game designed to teach players about environmental sustainability, proper waste management, and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Players nurture a virtual tree by earning **Green Points** through two engaging mini-games:

1. **Environmental Quiz** - Test your knowledge about SDGs, pollution, and recycling
2. **Trash Sorting Game** - Sort falling waste items into the correct color-coded bins

As players accumulate Green Points, their tree grows through multiple stages, from a small seed to a fully blossomed tree, symbolizing the positive impact of environmental actions.

## 🎮 Game Mechanics

### Core Gameplay Loop

- Players start with a small seed
- Complete mini-games to earn Green Points
- Green Points "water" the tree and help it grow
- Watch your tree transform through 5 growth stages:
  1. **Seed** (0-20 points)
  2. **Sprout** (21-50 points)
  3. **Sapling** (51-100 points)
  4. **Young Tree** (101-150 points)
  5. **Blossoming Tree** (151+ points)

### Mini-Game 1: Environmental Quiz

- Multiple-choice questions about environmental topics
- Topics include: SDGs, climate change, recycling, pollution, conservation
- +10 Green Points for each correct answer
- Educational feedback for wrong answers

### Mini-Game 2: Trash Sorting Game

- Random trash items fall from the top of the screen
- Move color-coded bins at the bottom to catch items correctly
- **Bin Color Coding (International Standard):**
  - 🟢 **Green Bin**: Recyclable waste (plastic bottles, paper, metal cans)
  - 🟤 **Brown Bin**: Organic waste (food scraps, leaves, biodegradable items)
  - ⚫ **Grey/Black Bin**: Other/Residual waste (non-recyclables)
  - 🔴 **Red Bin**: Hazardous waste (batteries, chemicals, electronics)
- +5 Green Points for correct sorting
- -3 Green Points for incorrect sorting
